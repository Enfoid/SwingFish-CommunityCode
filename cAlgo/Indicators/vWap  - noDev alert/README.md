vWap - noDev Alert

this is a "slick" version of the vWap we use in the SwingFish Intra Indicator.
can be downloaded here for free: https://www.swingfish.trade/swingfish-intra

it's lightweight so it can be loaded on multiple charts without creating too much load.
the newest version (init to GitHub) has also a Background feature to allow it to show visually where things are.
