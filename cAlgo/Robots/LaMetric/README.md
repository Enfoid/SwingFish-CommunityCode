ToDo:
 - send a actual Notification on Margin cross
 - position Notification ?
 - better app integration (getting auth to work can be "tricky" for some peoples)

Changes:
 - show margin and margin warning fixed
 - temp workaround for "show margin" setting (this needs to be smarter)
 - remove duplicate rounding (round negative values too)
 - Rounding to display larger numbers
 - try another way for margin settings
 - small icon changes
 - OnStop sends cTrader Icon and Text
 - Better icons
 - proper cTrader Icon (ID: 45063)
 - wife mode (auto select highest profit) .bin
 - fix "today display"
 - change meaning of Equity setting
   Todays PnL selects the highest (Balance or Equity)
 - code cleanup (by Jiri)
   - better frame build
   - duplicates removed
 - actually use the timer (not OnTick)
 - minor fixes)
 - choice to calculate TodaysPnL based on Balance or Equity
 - Better communication
 - fixed icon issue
 - added margin warning level (shows a different icon when level is crossed)
 - only shows "today" when no position is open
    
P.S. there is also a MT5 Version available
