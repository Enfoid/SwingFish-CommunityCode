ToDo:
 - send a actual Notification on Margin cross

 - remove duplicated "todays Profits"
 - add "arrows" Icon
 - use the word "loss" on daily stats
 - show margin and margin warning fixed
 - temp workaround for "show margin" setting (this needs to be smarter)
 - remove duplicate rounding (round negative values too)
 - Rounding to display larger numbers
 - try another way for margin settings

   - better frame build
   - duplicates removed
 - actually use the timer (not OnTick)
 - minor fixes)
 - choice to calculate TodaysPnL based on Balance or Equity
