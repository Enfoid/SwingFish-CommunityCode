ToDo:
 - send a actual Notification on Margin cross
 - position Notification ?
   (requires Notification API .. may be a Auth issue)
 - OnStop needs to wait a bit to complete the last transmission ..
   bot quits too fast last update of the clock does not work
 - better app integration (getting auth to work can be "tricky" for some peoples)

Changes:
 - Better icons
 - proper cTrader Icon (ID: 45063)
 - wife mode (auto select highest profit) .bin
 - fix "today display"

   Todays PnL selects the highest (Balance or Equity)
 - code cleanup (by Jiri)
   - better frame build
   - duplicates removed
 - actually use the timer (not OnTick)
 - minor fixes)
 - choice to calculate TodaysPnL based on Balance or Equity
 - Better communication
 - fixed icon issue
 - added margin warning level (shows a different icon when level is crossed)
 - only shows "today" when no position is open
    
P.S. there is also a MT5 Version available
